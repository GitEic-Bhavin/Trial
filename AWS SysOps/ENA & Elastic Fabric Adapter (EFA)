ENA - Enhanced Network Adeptor

ENA is use for improving latency at CDN Level.

ex. User is from USA, HOST is in INDIA.
    CND is configured.
if user is to trying to retrive the data. data will go through Multiple network.
so time is required to receive the data like 5 sec.

user want to get that data with few sec, 1 sec.

so, you can provide data in few sec, using NETWORK ENHANCED ADEPTOR.

This will provides Higher bandwidth of 100 GBPS. which will improve the latency at CDN Level.



This ENA is Works for newer generation EC2 Instances, NOT for older ec2 instance.

      t2.micro is older,         t3 is newer
      driver is vif              drier is ena is in-buided.




                                     Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)

It is Improved version of ENA
Use for HPC- High Performance Computing.
Great for inter-node communications, tightly coupled workloads.
