 					Elastic IP				07/03/2024
 					
When you launch ec2, you have public ip and private ip for that ec2.
after restart ec2, public ip will changed & your ec2 will start on another physical host at backend of AWS.

ex. Google.com have default public ip address 8.8.8.8

you want to keep this public ip forever like your own ip.
you have to assign a Elastic Ip to that ec2.

You don’t pay for the Elastic IP if it’s attached to a server.

You pay for the Elastic IP if it’s not attached to a server.

• How you can avoid using Elastic IP:
 
  • Always think if other alternatives are available to you
  • You could use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it
  • Or use a Load Balancer with a static hostname
  
NOTE:  With an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance.
