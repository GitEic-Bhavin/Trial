Change EC2 Instance Type. t2.micro to t2.small or in t3 version EC2.

Why we need to change instance type?
Bcz, for horizontal scaling (Auto Scaling) will adding or removing the ec2 as per traffic load.
   
 Auto scaling is supported only for  horizontal scaling.
 
 for vertical scaling, we have to modify ec2 memory by following steps.
 
 Step-1 Stop the instance & Right click on your ec2.
 Step-2 Instance Settings => Change Instance Type
 Step-3 Start Instance.
 
 for,    increase your ec2 size t2.micro to t2.small
         decrease your ec2 size t2.micro to t2.nano
